## Introduction
Welcome to the Ledn frontend technical challenge! In this assessment, you'll embark on a unique journey that draws inspiration from the challenges our company has faced in the past and continues to address in the ever-evolving landscape of financial technology.

Our team has encountered scenarios that require a fine balance between technical prowess and creative problem-solvingâ€”qualities we believe define an exceptional frontend engineer. To make this experience both engaging and relevant, we've infused the challenge with a touch of creativity, drawing inspiration from an iconic theme.

While the scenario we present is influenced by the Star Wars universe, please note that this is merely a creative backdrop. You won't be navigating the galaxy far, far away, but rather addressing real challenges that our company has encountered or is currently grappling with.

## The challenge
### Introduction
Welcome to the Coruscant Bank's engineering department. In a galaxy far, far away, following the fall of the Empire, the financial landscape is in disarray, and you, esteemed engineer, have been entrusted with a crucial mission.

You are now responsible for managing the financial affairs of high-net-worth clients in the tumultuous aftermath of the Empire's collapse. Your role is pivotal as you navigate through the remnants of the Imperial financial system to bring order to the chaos left in its wake.

As the chosen engineer, you have access to critical information:

* **Residents:** A roster of high-net-worth individuals whose fortunes are entwined with the fate of the galaxy.

* **Planets:** The vast array of planets where Coruscant Bank operates, each with its unique economic challenges and opportunities.

* **Transactions:** Detailed records of your clients' financial transactions, recorded in both the now obsolete "Imperial Crown Standard" and the widely accepted "Galactic Credit Standard".

In the wake of the Empire's fall, the Republic has turned to Coruscant Bank to aid in rectifying the administrative chaos left behind. Your mission is to build the foundation of the administrative application, which will eventually ensure the seamless transition of high-net-worth clients into the new era.

## Requirements

Your task is to design the foundation of a responsive user interface capable of identifying planets susceptible to uprisings and enabling proactive intervention. The objective is to build a UI that assists administrators in analyzing transactions across various planets. To meet this goal, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Summary**
    - The administrators would like to see a summary of all the planets of the galaxy.
    - From that list, they would like to be able to search for a planet by its name.
    - From that list, they would like to be able to re-order the planet by its name (ascending or descending).

2. **Detail**
    - The administrators would like to access detailed information for each planet.
    - They would like to be able to filter the transactions by its currency type (GSC and ICS)

### Technical requirements
To ensure the success of your mission, adhere to the following technical specifications:

* Organize the UI to the best of your knowledge and judgment.
    * All available data can be found in the `DataExample` component.
* Do not use any existing UI library or framework (nothing like Tailwind, Bootstrap or Material UI for instance).
    * Reset / normalize stylesheets are allowed.
* Provide screenshots or recording of the final implementation.
* In order to allow us to review a similar set of challenges, please do not change anything from the server.
